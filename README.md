# Bypassing payment for a premium wifi network
A demonstration of vulnerabilities in paid networks (Planes, hotels, truck stops, etc...) that use a public network with a mac address filter.

## This is for academic purposes only, accessing a network that you do not have permission to access is a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (18 U.S.C. ยง 1030). All testing is performed in a virtual network environment, or on a personal network. 

## This guide will only cover Linux and Windows devices. OSx would follow similar instructions to Linux. This is possible on a rooted Android device as well as a jailbroken iOS device, but this can cause issues with some applications. iMessage authenticates through MAC address so changing this will cause iMessage to stop working during the next authentication check for your device. With the new RMS on Android it may use a similar authentication method and as such you should excercise caution when testing on these devices.

### Requirements for this attack
- One of the many hypervisors such as Oracle VirtualBox or VMware.
- A network configured in your hypervisor that does not have a password, but uses MAC address whitelisting. 

1. You will need to open two virtual devices through your hypervisor. These do not need to have the same operating system. 
2. You need to find the MAC address for the device you plan to have whiteisted. Once you have added it to the whitelist you will only be working from the non-whitelisted device. 
3. Connect your non-whitelisted device to the network. You should be able to connect, but you will not have access to the internet. 
4. Open your terminal (Linux) or command prompt (Windows) window. 
5. You need to scan the network to find an authorized device. In our example we are going to do it in a simple way, but in a real attack a tool such as wireshark could be used to find users who are paid by seeing who is sending and recieving more data. 
Command for both windows and linux: `arp -a` (This will display all devices from the arp cache, this may not include all devices on the network).

You can see in the above images that you have multiple devices listed, and that you have access to their mac address (hardware address). Contrary to what the name may lead you to believe, you can change or 'spoof' your mac address very easily. 

### Spoof Hardware address on Windows
Changing the hardware address on windows can be done in multiple ways, but the easiest is to use Device Manager. 
1. Press Windows Key + X and select Device Manager.
2. Find the Network Adapter section, and expand the tree to see all of the options. Locate the adapter you are using to connect to the network, right click it, and select properties.

3. Once the Properties window opens, navigate to Advanced tab and select Network Address from the list of Properties.

4. Enter the target devices MAC address here and click OK. 

To revert the changes here you can simply go back and select the Not Present option.

5. At this point if the target device was a "paid" user you should be able to access the internet, as the network now thinks you are a whitelisted user.
